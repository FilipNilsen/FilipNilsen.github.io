<h1>Commodore OS Vision</h1>
<p>
I remember looking through a LINUX family three and seeing Commodore OS. This made me puzzled, surly Commodore went bankrupt in the 90's?<br>
Enter Barry S. width="800" height="600" altman, born in 1948 he co-owned telecommunications company Cabletek from the 70's to 1991. And from 2004 he started the furniture distributor and importer Homecraft.<br>
In 2010 he got the license to the Commodore brand from the companies who owned the rights to the Commodore and Amiga brand and founded Commodore USA.<br>
Commodore USA went on to some pieces of hardware. The most known is the Commodore 64 x witch was a Intel computer in a Commodore 64 case. They also made some keyboards.<br>
One thing I found interesting is that Commodore USA sent an <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/23756/Commodore_USA_Threatens_OSNews_with_Legal_Action"><u>angry email</u></a> to OSNews telling them to take down a critical article about Commodore OS, width="800" height="600" although they later regretted and made an <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/23993/Commodore_USA_s_CEO_Retracts_Legal_Threat_Apologises"><u>apology.</u></a><br>
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/23753/Commodore_Gets_Rights_to_Amiga_Hyperion_Takes_Legal_Action"><u>The original</u></a> article on OSNews talked about the problems between Commodore USA and Hyperion Entertainment.
Hyperion Entertainment also had rights to the Amiga brand and had the rights to develop the successor to Amiga OS 3.9 (Amiga OS 4.0) for the Power PC based AmigaOne computers and expansion cards made by other various companies who also had Amiga licenses (originally Amigas were Motorolla 680x0 but the expansion cards made them Power PC compliant).<br>
Of course both of them hawing the Amiga license led to some trademark disagreements, but I'm not gonna go into them.
</p>
<p>
But I'm not here to talk about the hardware and history I'm here to talk about the software. Their computers ran Ubuntu 10.10 <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu"><u>(source of the font I'm using)</u></a><br>
After some time they decided to make their own Linux operating system called Commodore OS Vision based on Linux Mint. They only reached beta 9 (for some reason the .iso I got said 1.0beta9 idk what that means is it beta9 of 1.0 or something..?)<br>
They tried to put Amiga OS on their computers somewhat, by putting <a href="http://aros.sourceforge.net/introduction/"><u>AROS</u></a> on them. AROS is an open source Amiga OS clone/replacement that is <a href="http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/users/faq.php#how-compatible-is-aros-with-amigaos"><u>compatible with Amiga OS (programs may need be  recompiled for different platforms).</u></a><br>
They did however never do that and we're stuck with <del>Linux Mint</del> Commodore OS Vision
