<h1>Windows on NES !!</h1>
<p><strong>Have you ever wanted to run Microsoft Windows on NES? Well of course not! <br>
However, the bootleggers could not hear you out on that and did it anyway.</strong></p>
<strong>The following versions of Windows exist for NES:
<ul>
	<li>Windows 98</li>
	<li>Windows 2000 (Chinese)</li>
	<li>Educational Computer 2000</li>
	<li>Windows 2000 (Russian)</li>
</ul></strong>
<p>So yeah, thats what they did... <br><br>
<strong>WHAT THE FUCK WHERE YOU THINKING !!</strong> Windows on Nintendo Entertainment System!? Why? Who asked for this? <br>
Well... In the case of both Russian and Chinese Windows 2000 I think I may have found out:<br>
The famiclone manufacturers asked for it. In case you never heard of it "famiclones" are illegal reverse engineered Famicoms (What they called the Nintendo in Japan).<br>
While most famiclones just had a cartridge slot and controllers some of them pretended to be computers!<br>
They where designed like 80's computers with the computer and keyboard being one unit.<br>
Others however would have the keyboard separate. Most of them would also feature 3.5" floppy disks and PS/2 ports and other connectors. Hell you could even get a printer !! <br>
<em>However... This was not enough. After all... All computers have a operating system so they needed one too...</em> <br>
So yeah, that's probably the reason for Windows 2000. It would probably boot from a cartridge or be stored in internal hardware.<br>
An interesting thing to point out is that there where several other operating systems for famiclones some had a simple GUI that usually ripped off Windows<br>
while others would be pretty advanced DOS operating systems. Some of these famiclone operating systems would even have programming tools.<br>
Sounds interesting? Well that's not all, some of these systems would boot from a 3.5" floppy disk !! </p>
<p>I'm not sure what windows 98 for NES was intended for but i doubt that it could have been a famiclone os. <br>
The two variants of Windows 2000 had several features, programs and games that where standard on keyboard famiclones. <br>
And a lot of software and games in them needs a keyboard.<br>
Windows 98 on the other hand has none of that. Hell, it doesn't have any usable programs at all, <br>
the programs are just images of programs. (No literally they are just images of em').</p><br>
<h1>So why don't we take a look at them:</h1>
