<h3>Because the truth is that Finland is fabricated by Japan and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Wait, what? Finland doesn't exist? How can that be? Well... lets start from the beginning.
On the 5<sup>th</sup> of Mars 2015 a guy made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finlandConspiracy/comments/2y0oog/the_finland_conspiracy_and_all_you_need_to_know/">reddit post</a> retelling what his parents told him: Finland doesn't exist. Essentially Russia and Japan has always had good relations even tough they should be hating each other like during WWII and the cold war.<br>
Why, simple! Because they both had a secret they benefited from! Finland is just open sea. You sea [pun intended] Japan needed somewhere to fish without worrying about fishing regulations due to environmental reasons.
So in exchange for some of the fish the Soviet Union helped Japan fabricate that there was land there so nobody would care about stopping japan due to environmental reasons. <br>
To transport the fish they made the Trans-Siberian Railway (that's the real reason it was built) and a cover company by the name  of "Nokia" that also explains why Japan imports most "Nokia" products while so few Japanese own a "Nokia".<br>
You are probably wondering how you explain all the Fins? Well they really live in East Sweden, West Russia and North Estonia. And Helsinki is also in East Sweden. Because "of course" maps are made to show what they want us to know.
The other nations that are not Japan or The Soviet Union are explained with that they accepted it as a sign of goodwill to the east. However, after some time it got some importance to the rest of the world. They could place Finland on the top of all good indexes and on the bottom of all bad:
On that way the world governments could use Finland as an example of how a perfect country should be and use Finland as an "idol" if you will.</p>
<p>Well to be fair: the person on reddit was joking. <strong>However</strong> to quote Poe's law: "it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers or viewers as a sincere expression of the parodied views" some people took this seriously (they even made the subreddit r/trueFinlandConspiracy)<br></p>
<p>To sum it up: It is a joke that some few idiots take seriously. And a rational person would probably believe that the creator was being serious, witch makes sense considering how many insane conspiracies that some people take seriously exist.</p>
<h4>That's all folks</h4>
